# Student-GPA-With-KNN-Regression
Predicting student GPA using KNN regression with Python and Power BI

# 🎓 GPA Prediction Using KNN Regression

This project uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** regression to predict student GPA based on lifestyle factors.

## 📌 Project Summary
Predict GPA using:
- 📘 Study Hours per Week
- 🛏 Sleep Hours
- 📱 Social Media Usage
- 💼 Part-Time Job status

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python 3.9 (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Power BI (for dashboard and insights)

## 📈 Key Insights
- More study hours → higher GPA (especially for students with no part-time job)
- Social media usage >15 hrs/week → lower GPA
- RMSE = 0.328 → strong model accuracy
